## Purpose:

This folder contains summaries of different software development books I have read. The notes are condensed down versions of the books. Generally, less technical books will be put here - more technical books (e,g: SICP) will have their own folders.

## Books Read+Summarized:

1) *Clean Architecture* (Robert C. Martin).

2) *Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices* (Robert C. Martin et al.).
