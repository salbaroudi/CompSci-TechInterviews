## Code Interview Practice:

This folder contains demonstrable proof of my understanding of the core topics in Computer Science.

Algorithms will be coded by hand and tested in JavaScript or Python, with a short write-up for each.

OneCompiler is used to give a live demonstration of the code - links will be provided for each.

**Note:** I implement these algorithms from scratch, with the goal of remembering/understanding
them and getting them working at an **reasonably effective** level.

I make no claim that my implementations are optimized, or the most efficient. Use a software
library if you want this level of guarantee.
