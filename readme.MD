## Code Interview Practice:

This folder contains demsonstrable proof of my understanding of the core topics in Computer Science and Software Development.

It contains the following folders:

- Algorithms & Data Structures: Will be coded by hand and tested in JavaScript or Python, with a short write-up for each.
- Leet Code: Copies of my solutions to solved Leet Code problems.
- Books: Software Development book summaries.
- Notes: Notes from tech deep-dives, or Coursera/Udemy courses I have completed.



**Note:** I implement these algorithms from scratch, with the goal of remembering/understanding
them and getting them working at an **reasonably effective** level.
